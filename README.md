# ImprovMusicDynamics
Python scripts for identifying transitions and quantifying dynamical regimes in audio files of freely improvised music.

These methods are described and motivated in our [CogSci proceedings paper](https://saige.sice.indiana.edu/wp-content/uploads/cogsci2018_msetzler.pdf) and the DynamicRegimes paper included in this repo. freejazz_novelty.py is an implementation of [Jonathan Foote's novelty function](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/869637).

ToDo:
Fix bug in freejazz_drift.py
